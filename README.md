Abstraxo is a new web tool for visualizing, and sharing information by generating mind maps, or concept maps, through an intuitive user interface.

As users define nodes, relations, and properties, Abstraxo draws a meaningful structure helping users better understand the information.

Nodes are self positioned, and can hold user defined properties; Multiple maps can be created in the same view; And import / export operations can help you share the generated structures.
