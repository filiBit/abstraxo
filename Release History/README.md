# Abstraxo Release History
## 9 June 2020
  **New feature:**
  - Hotkeys:
  
    From now on, you can use hotkeys to do most actions in the app ðŸ™‚
    
    The available hotkeys are shown in the **command card** that is displayed in the bootom right corner of the screen (visible only in widescreen mode).
  
    Command buttons are arranged in a grid, meaning that each buttons' position corresponds to a position of an assigned key on the keyboard.
    
    To see which key is mapped to a specific command button, just hover over it. Note how the app assumes keyboard with QWERTY layout, but regardless to that, the key bindings correspond to your actual keyboard layout, as expected:

    | QWERTY | QWERTZ | AZERTY | DVORAK |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | `Q` - `W` - `E` - `R` | `Q` - `W` - `E` - `R` | `A` - `Z` - `E` - `R` |  `'` - `,` - `.` - `L` | 
    | `A` - `S` - `D` - `F` | `A` - `S` - `D` - `F` | `Q` - `S` -`D` - `F` | `A` - `O` - `E` - `U` | 
    | `Z` - `X` - `C` - `V` | **`Y`** - `X` - `C` - `V` | `W` - `X` - `C` - `V` | `;` - `Q` - `J` - `K` |
